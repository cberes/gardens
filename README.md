# gardens

Record all the plants that are in your gardens.

> Can't I just look at my garden?

Sure, of course, but maybe you forget the names of your plants.
You know something is a goldenrod, but what kind of goldenrod?
Also, you can use this app to remember seeds you've planted.

## History

This started as a (campsite manager using Spring Boot)[https://github.com/cberes/campsites]
and then another attempt at a (campsite manager implemented as a serverless web app)[https://github.com/cberes/ohboywerecamping].
Those projects proved to be too large for my rapidly diminishing spare time.
However, I wanted to complete a personal project with the tools I use professionally: Java, Javascript, Vue, Spring, and AWS to name a few.
So I'm implementing a much smaller web app that's like a slice of the original campsite manager.
